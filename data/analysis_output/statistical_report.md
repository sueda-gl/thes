## Summary

- **Total participants:** 112 agents (56 Hope, 56 Fear)
- **Time points:** T0 (baseline), T1 (immediate), T2 (sustained)
- **Design:** 2×3 Mixed design (Between: Campaign × Within: Time)

## Primary Results

### Within-Group Changes: Did Campaigns Affect Beliefs? (✅ SIGNIFICANT)

**HOPE GROUP (n=56):**
- **Immediate (T1 vs T0):** Δ = -0.030, t(55) = -2.669, **p = 0.010** ✓
- **Sustained (T2 vs T0):** Δ = -0.064, t(55) = -3.300, **p = 0.002** ✓
- **Interpretation:** Hope campaign significantly DECREASED environmental concern

**FEAR GROUP (n=56):**
- **Immediate (T1 vs T0):** Δ = -0.020, t(55) = -2.187, **p = 0.033** ✓
- **Sustained (T2 vs T0):** Δ = -0.055, t(55) = -3.730, **p = 0.0005** ✓
- **Interpretation:** Fear campaign significantly DECREASED environmental concern

### Between-Group Comparison: Hope vs. Fear (✗ Not Significant)

**Immediate Effect (ΔT1-T0):**
- **Hope:** M = -0.030, SD = 0.085
- **Fear:** M = -0.020, SD = 0.067
- **t-test:** t(110) = -0.739, **p = 0.461**, d = -0.140
- **Interpretation:** No significant difference between Hope and Fear

**Sustained Effect (ΔT2-T0):**
- **Hope:** M = -0.064, SD = 0.146
- **Fear:** M = -0.055, SD = 0.111
- **t-test:** t(110) = -0.365, **p = 0.716**, d = -0.069
- **Interpretation:** No significant difference between Hope and Fear

## Key Finding

**Both Hope and Fear campaigns showed DECREASED environmental concern over time**, 
with no significant difference between framings. This unexpected finding suggests 
possible reactance effects to sponsored content markers.

## Recommendations for Thesis Discussion

1. **Frame as a valid negative finding:** Sponsored content markers may backfire
2. **Cite persuasion knowledge theory:** Friestad & Wright (1994)
3. **Emphasize methodology contribution:** Novel LLM-agent simulation
4. **Use qualitative THOUGHTS:** Quote examples of reactance
5. **Suggest future work:** Repeat without "SPONSORED POST" marker
